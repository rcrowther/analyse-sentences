“My Lady’s cause has been again before the Chancellor, has it, Tulkinghorn?” Sir Leicester, giving him his hand.

“Yes. It has been on again to-day.” Tulkinghorn replies, making one of his quiet bows to my Lady, who is on a sofa near the fire, shading her face with a hand-screen.

“It would be useless to ask” My Lady says with the dreariness of the place in Lincolnshire still upon her. “...whether anything has been done.”

“Nothing that YOU would call anything has been done to-day.” Replies Tulkinghorn.

“Nor ever will be,” My Lady spoke.
