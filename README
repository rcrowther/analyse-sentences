Dump in the Xed plugins folder, likely,

    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/xed/plugins

Or symlink from that folder to the source,

    sudo ln -s /place/of/code analyse-sentences

Then need to close all instances of Xed for a restart. On restart, the plugin should be detected. Then the plugin needs to be activated in,

> Edit > Preferences > Plugins

Then the new menu items should appear.
 
It's written in Python, so should appear from then out.
